## Synopsis

This is an advanced version of the Run-AvigilonApplianceSetup script. This script has more granular control over which features of the install to run, but without the graphical interface.


## Code Example

## Motivation

In my current position I provision a large quantity of Avigilon network video appliances according to the needs of our clients. I started out with a checklist of everything that needed to be configured and set each appliance up manually. Automating the whole process has freed up considerable time to work on other projects and drastically reduced the time between receiving an order and getting it installed for a client.

## Installation

Download a .zip of this project or clone it. The entire project is one PowerShell script broken into various functions. Requires at least PowerShell v4.
