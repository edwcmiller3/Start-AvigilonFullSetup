## Synopsis

This is an advanced version of the Run-AvigilonApplianceSetup script. This script has more granular control over which features of the install to run, but without the graphical interface.


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

In my current job I set up a large quantity of Avigilon network video appliances according to the needs of our clients. This is incredibly tedious so I wrote a script to automate the process.


## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
